# Analysis of the National Family Health Survey 4, 2015-16

This repo was created for Hindustan Time's Data assignment.

- All the code was written in a Jupyter notebook running on Python 3.

- The [requirements text file](https://github.com/amiham-singh/HT_dataAnalysis/blob/master/requirements.txt) has a list of libraries I used 

- You donâ€™t have to run the code in the notebook to see the analysis, I encourage you to access a check point of it [here]( https://github.com/amiham-singh/HT_dataAnalysis/blob/master/NFHS.ipynb)
